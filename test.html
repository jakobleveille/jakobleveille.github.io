    <!-- intro/about me-->

<p>ever since i was a little kid, i was fascinated with the world around me, and questioned how everything works. we take so much for granted as daily users of countless groundbreaking technologies - with no real concept of how they work. iâ€™m a diehard advocate for lifelong learning, constantly asking questions, and being intensely curious about anything and everything around us.</p>
<br>
<p>at the university of waterloo, i studied science & business, specialized in biotech, trying to get a better understanding of how we interact with the world. through coop, i was able to explore industries that i was intensely curious about, including transportation, finance, and pharmaceuticals. more recently, ive found a passion for making, building, and creating, especially in the climate-tech and software space. i started a (now sunsetted) company, montere,  attempting to build a completely modular espresso machine, and am currently learning about and working on a multitude of software and hardware projects.</p>
