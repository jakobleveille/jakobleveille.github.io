        <h2><span id ='randomFont2'>things i live by:</span></h2>

        <h3>lifelong learning is essential.</h3>

        <p>
            ever since i was a little kid, i was fascinated with the world around me, and questioned how everything works. we take so much for granted as daily users of countless groundbreaking technologies with no real concept of how they work. i'm a diehard advocate for lifelong learning, constantly asking questions, and being intensely curious about anything and everything around us. the world truly is your oyster, and its your job to explore it.
            <br><br>
            through university and coop, i was able to explore industries that i was intensely curious about, but have recently pivoted my learning business roles to technical - am currently learning as much as i can about hardware & software through a multitude of projects, including a solar-powered weather sensor for <a href="https://buildspace.so/">buildspace s5</a>, this site, and a new approach to digital discovey and exploration.
        </p>

        <h3>touch grass as often as possible.</h3>

        <p>
            there is a direct correlation between spending time outside and lower risks of depression, improved cognitive function, lower blood pressure, improved sleep - the list goes on. especially when working from home, it becomes so easy to become engrossed with whatever you are doing and spend hours on end indoors. i seem to do my best work after i have spent some time outdoors, or even when i am working outdoors on a patio or in a park, and cannot recommend spending as much as time as possible taking in the world around us.
            <br><br>
            i am an avid outdoor climber, snowboarder, runner/biker/swimmer, golfer (even though i'm terrible), gardening, and occasional park-reader.
        </p>

        <h3>take the leap - it's worth it.</h3>

        <p>
            life is too short to not do try new things and take risks. talk to a stranger, get a tattoo, travel - whatever it happens to be, just do it. just like lifelong learning, the world is yours to explore, and why not do everything that you can think of? besides the experiences along with taking risks, there are psychological benefits of stepping our of your comfort zone on a regular basis and pushing your limits!
            <br><br>
            i did a triathlon with 0 training, started a company in an industry i knew almost nothing about, and decided to go to socratica one sunday - these decisions ended up entirely reshaping my personal and professional life, and ive had the opportunity to work on amazing projects with amazing people that i would have never done otherwise.
        </p>

        <h3>community is the backbone of innovation. </h3>

        <p>
            accomplishments are so much more meaningful if you have someone to celebrate them with.  there truly is nothing more inspiring and impactful than surrounding yourself with people with similar goals, drive, and mentality - it makes the lows easier and the highs even more exciting.
            <br><br>
            i'm involved with <a href="https://www.socratica.info/">socratica</a>, co-working sessions for high effort passion projects, and am helping run <a href="kitchenwaterloo.notion.site">the kitchen waterloo</a>, an all-day & all-summer co-working space for students and new grads to work on what they are most passionate about, and ran events for the science & business students association @ uw during my time there.
